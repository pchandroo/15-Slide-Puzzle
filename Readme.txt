Implemented the 15-puzzle solver in a deterministic environment to find the end goal state from an input state. 
Different search methods (BFS, IDDFS, A Star, ID A star) were applied to traverse across the puzzle and 
finally compared the time complexity and efficiency of each method. 

The code runs in python 3 environment
